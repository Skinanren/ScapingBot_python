I need a simple bot that crawls websites page source to count and list the incoming ‚Äúinternal links‚Äù and ‚Äúanchor text‚Äù to the URL that user inputs.



The deliverable will consist of two pages.



PAGE ONE: User Entry
- User will enter URL that they want to know how many internal links are pointed at it
- Submit button



PAGE TWO: Reports Data Found

- While program is working it will have an ‚Äúin progress‚Äù icon

- Returns a pie chart at the top of the page showing the amount of each anchor text used up to 9 and then 10 will be all the rest and called ‚Äúother‚Äù

- Returns the total inner links pointing to URL of user‚Äôs input
IN TABLE UNDERNEATH

- Returns the URL of each inner link found

- Returns the anchor text of each inner link found

Est. Budget: $200.00

Milestone 1: Create Bot to Crawl Websites & Return Information on Internal Links

Just to clarify, the bot will need to crawl the entire website to extract this internal links that are going to the page the user inputs.

Hi Skina,



Thanks for the video. It's only missing the count of the anchor text and the pie chart.

I have received your letter.
I attached the count of the anchor text and the pie chart.
I hope you carefully see what is selected by my mouse.

I don't understand, I didn't see the anchor text count nor pie chart, just the number of times I'm assuming the count of inner links from the urls.

also, can you use this url: http://bingtingle.com/walt-disney/

I can see this url http://bingtingle.com/walt-disney/
But I don't understand what you want.
Isn't the number of anchor text at the left top of screen what you want?
It is pie chart that I think.

I want to see how many times a certain anchor text is used in the incoming internal links to the referenced URL.

that is what the pie chart will be created with

Skina Reni 07:52 PM
Do you want to know how many times the same url is used in all internal links?

Is there any sample photo and video you can show me?

Here is a screenshot of what output may look like. The only thing missing on this one is the number # of links in the pie chart to go along with the percentage.

I need to leave the office.
I am very tired of working full time for your assignment.
If you have other thing you want, you let me know.
It's very difficult to finish the promise in time what I said
